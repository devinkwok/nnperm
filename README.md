# Neural network symmetries and linear mode connectivity

## Requirements

Install `open_lth` in same directory.

## Usage

To train models for analysis, run `train-models.sh`.

To run experiments, run `exp-run.sh`.

See `exp-plots.ipynb` for results.

## Development

Geometric realignment algorithm and supporting functions in `nnperm.py`.
Previous implementation (with modifications) is kept in `nnperm_old.py` for testing purposes. 

To run unit tests, call `python test_nnperm.py`.
